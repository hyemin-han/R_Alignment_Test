# Tutorial for measurement alignment with R (sirt)
 
In this code, I will demonstrate how to perform:

1. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis
2. Measurement Alignment
3. Monte Carlo simulations
4. Calculation of adjusted factor scores

to address the potential non-invariance issue in cross-national and/or cross-cultural research. To test the source code, the following R packages are required: lavaan, sirt, foreach, parallel, doParallel, psych, MASS.

This tutorial uses the open dataset used in Fischer and Karl (2019).
